Hi my name is Bakari and I wanted to showcase a few of my skills on this project. This utilizes a few of the technologies I picked up over the years for a POC. 

Most of my github contributions are on private repos so this is a glimpse of what I normally add to a project. I hope you enjoy, you can run the project with yarn start or visit this link [here](https://calm-bienenstitch-b4a8a4.netlify.app/)
